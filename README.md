# distfitjs

This is a JavaScript library that fits theoretical distributions to data.
It can be used in node.js or the browser (via distfit.min.js).
Fitting is done using **both parametric and non-parametric methods.**
Distfitjs is lightweight and has no dependencies.

## Examples
See the `examples/` directory.

Given some data:

Compute a (Gaussian) kernel density estimate:

## Basic Usage

## Documentation
Grunt is used as a task runner for distfit. 
There are two available grunt tasks:

+ Generating documentation from the source: `grunt jsdoc`
+ Running tests: `grunt mochaTest`

See `Gruntfile.js` for details.

For web applications, `distfit.min.js` can be generated by running `npm run build-browser`.
This uses Browserify to concatenate the source and expose `require`.
